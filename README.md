# Advent of Code 2021

This is my first year doing Advent of Code. My aim is to primarily use pytorch functions (and some preprocessing). Main rules:

1. Single pass over input file to store input data into a Tensor
2. No use of for loops or list/set/dict comprehensions

I don't expect to get very far.
